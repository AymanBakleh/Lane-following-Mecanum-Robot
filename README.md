# Mecanum
This is a repository for my Mecanum wheeled Robot which is controlled by opencv and PID controller
it is equirbed with an ultrasonic sensor and a gyro sensor 
with 4 nima 17 stepper motors and a cnc shield with 4 motor drivers 
the structure is made from wood and the wheels are printed using a printer from kiddy teck 
I used pla for the rollers and abs for the sides of the wheels 
I have attached a voltometer clock on the side
